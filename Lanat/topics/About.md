Lanat is a command line argument parser for Java 17 with ease of use and high customization possibilities in mind.

Lanat is _extremely_ easy to set up and use. While allowing you to have a very rich argument parser in very few
lines of code, it also provides you with a lot of customization options to make your argument parser look and
behave exactly the way you want it to.
