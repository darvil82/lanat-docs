# Argument Groups

[Commands](Commands.md) can contain argument groups. Groups allow you to organize the arguments in the command in a more
structured way so that the user can understand the purpose of each argument better.

Groups are mostly useful for the help message generation, where they can be seen visually affecting the representation of
how arguments are displayed.
